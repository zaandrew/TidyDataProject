CODEBOOK

The dimension of this dataset is 180 rows (not including the row with the title) and 73 columns. This data contain observations for 30 subjects that participated in the experiment and performed 6 particular activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist.  
Many different measurements were collected through this experiment that comes from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

angle

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean 


Work Performed to the dataset:
-------------------------------------------

1.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
